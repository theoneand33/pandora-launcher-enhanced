## FAQ

### Where can I suggest a feature/report a bug?

Please use GitHub issues.

### Why should I use Pandora over other launchers?

At this point, you probably shouldn't since it doesn't have feature parity with other launchers.

### Will Pandora be monetized?

Unlikely, for a few reasons:
- I believe that it is wrong for launchers to be monetized without distributing revenue back to mod creators that give the launcher value in the first place. Since I don't have the infrastructure to be able to redistribute revenue to mod creators, this is a big barrier.
- Dealing with monetization takes a lot of (ongoing) work, probably more work than creating the launcher itself.
- I personally dislike advertisements.
