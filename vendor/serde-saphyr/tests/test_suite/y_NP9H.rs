    // - In double-quoted scalars, a single line break folds to a SPACE.
    // - An EMPTY line becomes a REAL newline '\n'.
    // - A backslash '\' at end of a line ESCAPES the following newline (no space/newline inserted),
    //   and leading indentation on the next line is ignored.
    // - "\t" produces a TAB character.
