# Changelog
## v0.0.7
- Added `YamlVersion` and changed `Event::DocumentStart` to
  `DocumentStart(bool, Option<YamlVersion>)`, emitting the `%YAML` directive
  version for each document start when present.
- Added `Tag::suffix_in_namespace`, which returns the type name a tag resolves to within
  an arbitrary namespace prefix (matching the resolved `handle ++ suffix` URI across every
  spelling, including `%TAG` mid-name splits). This generalizes `Tag::core_suffix`, which
  now delegates to it.
- Add Tag::suffix_in_namespace: resolved type name within an arbitrary namespace
- Summarizing results of automated fuzzing and static analysis, robustness against malformed (bad intent) 
  YAML input was further hardened.

## v0.0.6
- Added `Tag::core_suffix` and made core-tag helpers match the resolved YAML 1.2.2
  Core Schema tags (`null`, `bool`, `int`, `float`, `map`, `seq`, and `str`)
  instead of checking only the resolved handle.
- Added `Span::indent` hints for non-empty block scalar content while leaving
  whitespace-only block scalar spans unannotated.

## v0.0.5
- Performance improvements on comment parsing
- Added `Span::tag_start` metadata for parser-emitted tagged node events, so diagnostics can point
  at the explicit tag token even when the node span starts on a later line.
- Added `Tag::original_handle`, `Tag::original_parts`, and `Tag::original` so consumers can inspect
  the tag handle as written before `%TAG` directive resolution and reconstruct normalized
  author-facing tag spelling, including verbatim tags (breaking change).

## v0.0.4
  Retracted

## v0.0.3

- Added `Span::slice(&str)` for convenient source extraction from parser-emitted
  spans when byte offsets are available.
- Added small `Tag` inspection helpers (`is_yaml_core_schema_tag`, `is_custom`,
  `parts`) for YAML-core-namespace and non-core-namespace tag consumers.
- Added `Event` inspection helpers (`anchor_id`, `alias_id`, `tag`, `scalar`,
  `is_node`) for ergonomic access to per-event node metadata. `anchor_id`
  returns `Option<usize>` for events that define an anchor; `alias_id` returns
  `Option<usize>` for aliases that reference an anchor; `is_node` returns `true`
  for any event that produces a value in the document tree.
- Added comment events. Comments are emitted as parser
  `Event::Comment(text, placement)` events with normal companion spans, and as
  scanner comment tokens carrying `Placement` metadata. This is an event-stream
  change: consumers building YAML data trees should ignore comment events, while
  formatting/linting tools can use the placement hint and comment span.
- Added `StructureStyle` metadata for sequences and mappings, exposed on
  `Event::SequenceStart(style, anchor_id, tag)` and
  `Event::MappingStart(style, anchor_id, tag)` events.
- Added `ParserStack::push_include` as an include-oriented alias for
  `ParserStack::resolve`.
- Added a custom-tag example showing how to inspect application tags such as
  `!degrees` from the event stream.
- Added an include-stack example demonstrating `!include`-style resolution
  through `ParserStack`.
- Updated the README minimal example to show `Span::slice` alongside byte
  ranges.
- Fixed the span of quoted (single- and double-quoted) scalars to end at the
  closing quote rather than after trailing whitespace and an optional
  end-of-line comment. This makes `Span::slice` return only the scalar source.
- Fixed pedantic Clippy warnings and switched into pedantic mode.

## v0.0.2

**Features**:

- Added `TryEventReceiver`, `TrySpannedEventReceiver`, `TryLoadError`,
  `Parser::try_load`, and `ParserTrait::try_load` for receiver-style parsing
  that can fail fast with an application error. The existing `load` API remains
  unchanged for infallible receivers.

## v0.0.1

Initial `granit-parser` release after splitting the parser into its own
standalone package.

**Breaking Changes**:

- Renamed the package to `granit-parser` and the Rust crate path to
  `granit_parser`.
- Raised MSRV to `1.81.0`.
- Made the library `no_std` by default, with `alloc` enabled internally.
- Changed parser events, scanner tokens, receivers, and parse-result aliases to
  carry an input lifetime.
- Changed scalar, tag, anchor, alias, and tag-directive payloads to use
  `Cow<'input, ...>` so `&str` input can avoid allocations.
- Renamed `TScalarStyle` to `ScalarStyle`.
- Changed `Marker::index()` and error messages to report character positions.
  Byte positions are now optional and available through `Marker::byte_offset()`
  and `Span::byte_range()`.
- Added `Span::indent` for parser-emitted indentation hints.
- `debug_prints` no longer reads environment variables. Debug output is now
  controlled by the feature and a local compile-time toggle in `src/debug.rs`.

**Features**:

- Added `BorrowedInput` and byte-slicing support for inputs that can safely
  borrow from stable source storage.
- Added zero-copy scanning for `StrInput` across plain scalars, quoted scalars,
  anchors, aliases, tags, and tag directives when no decoding is needed.
- Added `Parser::new_from_iter` as the iterator-backed constructor.
- Added `ParserTrait`, `ParserStack`, and `ReplayParser` for stacked parser
  workflows and replayed event streams.
- Added anchor offset management for stacked/replayed parser use cases.
- Added `Tag::is_yaml_core_schema()` and `Display` for `Tag`.
- Exported the input module and scanner/token types needed by downstream tools.

**Fixes**:

- Reject unclosed and misplaced flow brackets with diagnostics pointing at the
  relevant opening or closing marker.
- Reject unclosed quoted scalars with an `unclosed quote` diagnostic.
- Reject comment-interrupted multiline plain scalars instead of silently
  truncating the scalar.
- Handle reserved directives according to YAML rules while still rejecting
  malformed `%YAML` directives.
- Handle JSON-style surrogate pairs in quoted scalars and reject unpaired,
  reversed, or invalid surrogate escapes.
- Fix several flow mapping and flow sequence edge cases, including empty
  implicit keys and nested implicit mappings.
- Fix plain-scalar handling around `---`, `...`, `:`, `-`, tabs, and flow
  indicators.
- Fix block scalar indentation, chomping, kept trailing lines, tabs in scalar
  bodies, and non-ASCII span accounting.
- Fix document marker spans so `---` and `...` are emitted at the marker that
  triggered them.
- Fix spans for empty scalars, null values, mapping keys, non-ASCII input,
  comments, and block scalars.
- Avoid parser hangs and panic paths found by regression and fuzz tests.

**Performance**:

- Added fast ASCII paths for `StrInput`.
- Added chunked plain-scalar scanning and faster comment skipping.
- Switched several small parser/scanner stacks from `Vec` to `smallvec`.

**Build and Package**:

- Made the root crate standalone instead of relying on workspace-inherited
  package metadata.
- Removed unused root dependencies and dev-dependencies, including the old
  high-level YAML loader, `hashlink`, `miette`, `quickcheck`, `rustyline`, and
  `thiserror`.
- Added `smallvec` and disabled default features for `arraydeque`.
- Forbid unsafe code through crate attributes and Cargo lints.
- Renamed root tool binaries to `time_parser` and `run_parser`.

**Tests and CI**:

- Updated tests to use `granit_parser` and the lifetime/Cow-based event API.
- Run parser regression tests against both `StrInput` and `BufferedInput`.
- Replaced the YAML test-suite loader with a local fixture reader so the root
  crate no longer needs a high-level YAML parser as a dev-dependency.
- Added regression coverage for flow brackets, comments, document markers,
  block scalars, indentation hints, tabs, plain scalar indicators, surrogate
  escapes, non-ASCII positions, parser stacks, and fuzz-discovered inputs.
- Added a README example regression test.
- Added CI coverage for clippy, formatting, host library tests without default
  features, and `wasm32v1-none` `no_std` library checks.

**Documentation and Tools**:

- Rewrote crate docs and README examples for `granit-parser`.
- Added README coverage for repository tools.
- Added the standalone `tools/walk` helper crate for navigating parsed YAML
  spans.

## v0.0.6

**Fixes**:
- Fix emitting of tags with empty handles. `!tag` no longer emits as `!!tag`.

## v0.0.5

**Breaking Changes**:

- Emit `Cow<'input, Tag>` instead of `Tag` to avoid copies.

**Fixes**:

- 8ef76dcc: Fix `Marker`s for `null` and empty values.
- Fix `Span`s for collections to correctly mark the end of the collection.

**Changes**

- Exclude `yaml-test-suite` from the Cargo package.
- Bump `libtest-mimic` to `0.8.1`.

## v0.0.4

**Breaking Changes**:

- Allow events to borrow from the input.
- Rename `TScalarStyle` to `ScalarStyle`.

## v0.0.3

**Breaking Changes**:

- 926fdfb: Events now use spans rather than markers, allowing for tracking both
  the beginning and the end of scalars.
- 6c57b5b: Add a boolean to `DocumentStart` to know whether the start was
  explicit (`---`) or implicit.

**Features**:

- Add an `Input` interface to prepare the ground to future input-specific.
  optimizations (such as returning `Cow`'d strings when possible). This also
  potentially allows for user-defined optimizations.
- Add `Parser::new_from_iter` to load from an iterator. This automatically
  wraps using `BufferedInput`, which implements the new `Input` trait the
  `Parser` needs.

**Fixes**:

- 750c992: Add support for nested implicit flow mappings.
- 11cffc6: Fix error with deeply indented block scalars.
- d3b9641: Fix assertion that could erroneously trigger with multibyte
  characters.
- 95fe3fe: Fix parse errors when `---` appeared in the middle of plain scalars.
- 3358629: Fix infinite loop with `...` in plain scalars in flow contexts.
- Fix panics on other various erroneous inputs found while fuzzing.

**Internal changes**:

- Run all tests with both `Input` backends
- #15: Add fuzzing

## v0.0.2

This release does not provide much but is needed for the `saphyr` library to
depend on the new features.

**Breaking Changes**:

**Features**:
- Add `Marker::default()`
- Rework string handling in `ScanError`

**Fixes**:
- [yaml-rust2 #21](https://github.com/Ethiraric/yaml-rust2/issues/21#issuecomment-2053513507)
  Fix parser failing when a comment immediately follows a tag.

**Internal changes**:
- Various readability improvements and code cleanups
